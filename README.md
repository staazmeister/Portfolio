# Portfolio
Week 20 Homework: 
This week's project was to update my portfolio to showcase projects and featured homework's for future employers to review.


## User Story (provided in the homework instructions from week 20)
```
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

```

## Acceptance Criteria (provided in the homework instructions from week 20)
```
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
WHEN I view the header
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
WHEN I view the navigation titles

# Portfolio
Week 2 Homework
This week's project was to create a web application from scratch that will serve as a porfolio page that can be updated as we progress through the program.


*Since I currently do not have any projects to showcase at this time, please be advised that I have insert placeholders that will take you to my GitHub page. This is only temporary and will be updated accodingly once I have new projects to showcase.*



## User Story (provided in the homework instructions)
```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria (provided in the homework instructions)
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
